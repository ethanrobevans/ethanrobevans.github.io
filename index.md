excerpt: "About Me..."
---

I am a **Bioinformatics and Computational Biomedicine** Ph.D. student at Oregon Health & Science University. I am interested in the development of high-impact bio-technology to treat disease and enhance people's lives. More specifically, I want to use Machine Learning and other informatic techniques to guide and improve the engineering for technology development. I hope to position myself at the intersection of engineering, biology, physics and informatics. I have worked on a variety of projects auxillary to Optical Projection Tomography Microscopy (OPTM) and the development of lung cancer diagnostics at [Visiongate, Inc.](visiongate.com). I've been fortunate enough to be involved on prjects that gave me opportunity to create novelty and am listed on several pending patents because of it. If you would like to learn more about my current or past projects please see the [projects](projects.md) tab.
