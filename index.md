excerpt: "About Me..."

Thanks for visiting :) This site is all about me.  

I am a **Bioinformatics and Computational Biomedicine** Ph.D. student at Oregon Health & Science University. I'm interested in the development of high-impact bio-technology to treat disease and enhance people's lives and specifically, using Machine Learning and other informatic techniques to guide and improve technology development. I like to imagine myself at the intersection of engineering, biology, physics and informatics. I have worked on a variety of projects mostly focused on Optical Projection Tomography Microscopy (OPTM) for use in lung cancer diagnostics. I've been fortunate enough to be involved on prjects that gave me opportunity to create novelty and am listed on several pending patents because of it. If you would like to learn more about my current or past projects please see the [projects](projects.md) tab.
