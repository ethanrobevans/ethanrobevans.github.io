# A few of my projects to date  

## Micro Hydro-Kinetic Generator

![ams](/images/Senior Design Modeling.png)   

### Goal
The goal of this self-proposed project was to design, build and test a micro hydro-kinetic generator. This system would harness purely kinetic energy from fluidic flow. Traditional hydropower methods such as dams involve using hydrostatic head which requires intensive infrastructure which is not only expensive but can be environmentally destructive. Our design would be simple to manufacture and easy to install.

### Potential
The amount of kinetic energy in fluid flow is cubically correlated to the velocity of the flow. For a circular cross-section, the energy density of water is shown in the following graph:

According to Betz's Law, the theoretical maximum harnessable energy for a freely mounted turbine is 16/27 of the total kinetic energy available. Most modern wind turbines achieve roughly 80% of that maximum. Given these efficiencies, a small 1/2 meter diameter device mounted in 3 m/s velocity flow could produce roughly 1.25 kW of energy.

### Design
The design we chose was a tri-blade horizontal axis turbine with a centrally mounted generator. The generator was a three phase motor designed by a company named BlueRobotics. We were able to run this motor backwards while being completely submerged. The blades and housing were designed in several configurations and created using additive manufacturing for quick prototyping. Several different inlet configurations were tested to see if pre-treating the incoming flow could allow for an increased efficiency.
