# Here are some projects to date 

## UW Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) Team 
Along with several other undergraduates at the University of Washington, I helped found the UW ROV team, which has since been renamed the Underwater Robotics Club, and within this team built a functional submersible with which we participated in the 2015 MATE competition.

My personal contributions to the team revolved around the conception, design and manufacturing of the pneumatic manipulator and thurster mounts, seen below.
