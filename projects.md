# Here are some projects to date 

##Academic Research
###OPTM CARTRIDGE REDESIGN FOR LARGE NEEDLE BIOPSIES
During my senior year of undegraduate studies, I worked in the Human Photonics Labratory (HPL) with Dr. Eric Seibel and Dr. Ronnie Das. While there, I worked on projects focused on Optical Projection Tomography (OPT) Microscopy (OPTM) adapted to large specimen imaging. The device modeled above was designed to be used in a Visiongate, Inc. produced OPT microscope to image large needle biopsies. For more information, see the full [write-up](OPTM Large Specimen Imaging, NAU Presidential Fellowship Writing Example.pdf)

## UW Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) Team 
Along with several other undergraduates at the University of Washington, I helped found the UW ROV team, which has since been renamed the Underwater Robotics Club, and within this team built a functional submersible with which we participated in the 2015 MATE competition.

My personal contributions to the team revolved around the conception, design and manufacturing of the pneumatic manipulator and thurster mounts, seen below.
