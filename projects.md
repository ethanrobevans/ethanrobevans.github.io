# A few of my projects to date  

## Micro Hydro-Kinetic Generator

# Goal
The goal of this self-proposed project was to design, build and test a micro hydro-kinetic generator. This system would harness purely kinetic energy from a fluid flow. Traditional hydropower methods involve using hydrostatic head which requires intesive infrastructure which is not only expensive but can be environmentally destructive.

# Potential
The amount of kinetic energy in a fluid flow is cubically correlated to the velocity of the flow. For a circular generator the energy density of water looks like so:

# Design
The design we chose was a tri-blade horizontal axis turbine with a centrally mounted generator. The generator was a three phase motor designed by a company named BlueRobotics. The benefit of this was to be able to run the motor backwards while being completely submerged. The blades and housing were designed in several configurations and created using additive manufacturing for quick prototyping. Several different inlet configurations were tested to see if pre-aligning the incoming flow could allow an increased efficiency.
